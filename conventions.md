# File Names
This mod uses the Main Java Conventions for everything Java related. Resources on the other hand...
> For SCPs its always `scp<number>` <br>
> And if they have a glow layer, it's appended with `_glow<variant>` (`<variant>` being for multicoloured glows)
> Everything else its just what it is and spaces replaced with "_"

# Code Conventions
This mod uses all Java Conventions, however with a few tweaks to satisfy Connor's "OCD"

```java
public class SomeClass {
    public void numVariables() {
        //Floats and Doubles are to be formatted like so
        double x = 0.2D; //Correct!
        x = .2; //Incorrect!
        x = .2D; //Incorrect!
        
        //If you use a Full number as a double the .0 can be ignored
        x = 2D; //Correct!
        x = 2.0D; //Incorrect!
        
        //Autogenerated variables are to be left untouched as that is an exception
    }

    public void registeringSCPs() {
        //When registering an SCP, make sure that you do not use its name or put a _ after SCP
        //Here's an Example
        var SCP106; //Correct!
        var SCP_106; //Incorrect!
        var scp106; //Incorrect! (This would be incorrect to the convention since all the registration vars are final)
    }

    public static void someMethod(int i, boolean b, float f) {}
    public static void referencingFunctions() {
        //When referencing a function with multiple variables, make sure to have each variable one space away from the ,
        //Here are some examples

        someMethod(1, true, 5.2F); //Correct!
        someMethod(1,true,5.2F); //Incorrect!
        someMethod(1 ,true ,5.2F); //Incorrect!
    }

    public void logicCode() {
        //When using logic on entities/blocks etc... make sure to use these
        if (level.isClientSide) return;
        //Code

        //Is Preferred Over

        if (!level.isClientSide) { /*Code*/ }
        //This isn't a MUST, but the first one is preferred

        //Be sure to check the overtime.core.util.CommonCode file as it contains a few useful functions used throughout commonly throughout the mod
    }
}
